# ggplot2
I just upload some figures and codes which I made with ggplot2. I guess it will be helpful for myself and someone who is new for this area.

* **data vis**
  - barplot 1, which is a plot from RNA-Seq to show top 30 genes were induced by some stimuli. [barplot 1](https://github.com/liyi983923/data_analysis/blob/main/data-vis/barplot1.r)
  - barplot 2, which is a plot to show the GO data from a RNA-Seq. [barplot 2](https://github.com/liyi983923/data_analysis/blob/main/data-vis/barplot2.r)
* **drug screen**
  - G protein bias [S1PR1](https://github.com/liyi983923/data_analysis/tree/main/GPCR_drug_screen/G_protein_bias)
  - BMG testing [cell based assay to screen the compounds targets to various of GPCR targets](https://github.com/liyi983923/data_analysis/blob/main/GPCR_drug_screen/BMG_testing/figure.pdf)
